## Raw Assets

If you'd like to use the assets directly, you can download our [asset kit](https://www.phosphoricons.com/assets/phosphor-icons.zip).

- **SVGs** – Individual icon SVGs, in both minified and original formats retaining design-time detail.
- **Icon Font** – Use the icons as you would text, in print and other applications where full-fledged graphical elements are undesirable.
